Welcome to the chess game!

In this Python project, you can choose between playing or watching a simulation of a game. Note: to play, you must use the following notation to make your moves:
p1 a1, where p represents a piece, 1 represents the piece's identification, and a1 represents a square. In addition, the piece and the square you want to play must be separated by a space. The piece identifications are shown below: p (pawn), h (knight), r (rook), b (bishop), q (queen), k (king). There are currently some issues with the replay option, among others, but there should be no problems in a normal game.
